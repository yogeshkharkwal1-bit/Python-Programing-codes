# Loops in python
for i in range(1,11):
    print(i*26)
"""Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a specific condition is met.
They help in reducing code repetition and make programs shorter and easier to read.

üßæ Types of Loops in Python
1Ô∏è‚É£ for Loop

Used when you know how many times you want to repeat the block of code.

Works with range(), lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, etc. (iterables).

Syntax:

for variable in sequence:
    # code block


‚úÖ Example:

for i in range(5):
    print(i)


üîπ Prints numbers from 0 to 4.

2Ô∏è‚É£ while Loop

Used when you don't know how many times you need to repeat.

Runs until a condition becomes False.

Syntax:

while condition:
    # code block


‚úÖ Example:

i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1

3Ô∏è‚É£ Nested Loops

A loop inside another loop.

Commonly used for patterns and working with 2D data.
‚úÖ Example:

for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")

üõë Loop Control Statements

break ‚Üí Stops the loop immediately.

continue ‚Üí Skips the current iteration and moves to next.

pass ‚Üí Does nothing, just a placeholder.

üéØ Advantages of Loops

Reduces code repetition

Makes programs shorter and more readable

Useful for automation, data processing, and pattern printing"""
