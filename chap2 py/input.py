a=input("enter the first num")
b=input("enter the second num")

print("num a is",a )
print("num b is",b)
print("the sum of nnum a and num b is",a+b)

# output is
# enter the first num25
# enter the second num54
# num a is 25
# num b is 54
# the sum of nnum a and num b is 2554

# the input is always a string form thats why th e output of sum is (merging the num)
# example (a=4,b=8 ,sumj of a and b is 48)
#  to solve the problem we define the input type like int,float

a=int(input("enter the first num"))
b=int(input("enter the second num"))

print("num a is",a )
print("num b is",b)
print("the sum of nnum a and num b is",a+b)

# the output are totally difrnt 

# enter the first num25
# enter the second num54
# num a is 25
# num b is 54
# the sum of nnum a and num b is 79
